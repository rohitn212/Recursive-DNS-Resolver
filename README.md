# Recursive-DNS-Resolver

A recursive DNS resolver that takes a domain name and returns a summary of DNS information about the domain by recursively querying servers starting from the root server level.

Install the dnspython(http://www.dnspython.org/) library before running the program. In order to run the program, type "python resolve.py" followed by the domain name, for example "python resolve.py yahoo.com".
